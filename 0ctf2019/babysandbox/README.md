# Overview

Editors Note: This challenge requires a Ubuntu GLIBC 2.23-0ubuntu11 to work but it has been re-compiled to work with the current Ubuntu environment used in pwn.college.

The initial challenge had server as their executable and not babysandbox, the name change was done so the user is able to find the executable easily due to the naming scheme in pwn.college.
