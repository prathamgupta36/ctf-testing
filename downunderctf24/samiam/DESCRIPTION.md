The attacker managed to gain Domain Admin on our rebels Domain Controller! Looks like they managed to log on with an account using WMI and dumped some files.<br>
Can you reproduce how they got the Administrator's Password with the artifacts provided?

Place the Administrator Account's Password in `DUCTF{}`, e.g. `DUCTF{password123!}`
