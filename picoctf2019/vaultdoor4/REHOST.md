# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [picoCTF 2019](https://github.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/tree/main/ctfs/picoCTF/2019/rev/vault-door-4)

## Challenge Setup
There is only 1 file which is `VaultDoor4.java` that does not have any dependencies.

## Flag Check
As this challenge has its own custom flag so we use a simple flag check binary where the hacker can inputs the challenge flag and get the pwn.college flag.
Command to run flag check-
```
/challenge/flagCheck
```
