# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [picoCTF 2019](https://github.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/tree/main/ctfs/picoCTF/2019/pwn/messy-malloc)

## Challenge Setup
There are no dependecy files for `auth` and `auth.c` so it should work as intended.

## Flag Check
As this challenge has its own custom flag so we use a simple flag check binary where the hacker can inputs the challenge flag and get the pwn.college flag.
Command to run flag check-
```
/challenge/flagCheck
```
