## Challenge Setup
This challenge has no dependencies, if you download the files as in the above link it should work as intended.

## Flag Check
As this challenge has its own custom flag so we use a simple flag check binary where the hacker can inputs the challenge flag and get the pwn.college flag.
Command to run flag check-
