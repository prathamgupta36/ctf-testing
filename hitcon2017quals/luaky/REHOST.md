# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [HITCON CTF 2017](https://github.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/blob/main/ctfs/HITCON/2017/Quals/luaky.elf)

## Challenge Setup
This challenge has only one file which is `luaky.elf` that does not have any dependencies.

## Flag Check
As this challenge has its own custom flag so we use a simple flag check binary where the hacker can inputs the challenge flag and get the pwn.college flag.
Command to run flag check-
```
/challenge/flagCheck
```
