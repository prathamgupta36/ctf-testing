# REHOSTING

Files can be found here: [angstromctf](https://github.com/blairsec/challenges/tree/master/angstromctf/2024/crypto/tss1)

## Challenge Setup
Only two files for `tss1.py` and `key.txt` where `key.txt` is used by `tss1.py`.

## Installing fastecdsa
This challenge requires `fastecdsa` to be installed which can be done using this command:
```
#!/bin/bash

pip install fastecdsa
```

We have it in the `.init` file so the link is created between the files as soon as the challenge is started for each new environment.
