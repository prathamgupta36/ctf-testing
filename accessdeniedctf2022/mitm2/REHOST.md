# REHOSTING

Link to files: [AccessDeniedCTF 2022](https://github.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/tree/main/ctfs/AccessDenied/2022/crypto/MITM-2)

## Challenge Setup
This challenge does not have linked files or dependencies. The only files that we are going to use are `AES.py`, `Alice.py`, `Bob.py`.

## Flag Check
As this challenge has its own custom flag so we use a simple flag check binary where the hacker can inputs the challenge flag and get the pwn.college flag.
Command to run flag check-
```
/challenge/flagCheck
```
