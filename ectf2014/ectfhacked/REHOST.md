## Challenge Setup
This challenge has only one folder which is `ECTF_Hacked` which does not have any dependencies.

## Flag Check
As this challenge has its own custom flag so we use a simple flag check binary where the hacker can inputs the challenge flag and get the pwn.college flag.
Command to run flag check-
```
/challenge/flagCheck
```
