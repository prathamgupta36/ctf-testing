# REHOSTING

Link to files: [corCTF 2021](https://github.com/sajjadium/ctf-archives/tree/main/ctfs/corCTF/2021/pwn/CShell)

## Challenge Setup
The challenge consists of two files, `Cshell` which is a binary executable and `Cshell.c` which is the source code for `Cshell'. After downloading the files, the challenge should work as intended.

## Flag Check
As this challenge has its own custom flag so we use a simple flag check binary where the hacker can inputs the challenge flag and get the pwn.college flag.
Command to run flag check-
```
/challenge/flagCheck
```
